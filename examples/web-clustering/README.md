Simple example to highlight Web session sharing between pod instances

Setup openshift
===============

* Import builder image:
```
oc import-image wildfly --from=quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-centos7:latest --confirm
```
* Import runtime image: 
```
oc import-image wildfly-runtime --from=quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-runtime-centos7:latest --confirm
```
* Chained build template: 
```
oc create -f templates/wildfly-s2i-chained-build-template.yml
```
* Allow to view all pods in the project: 
```
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default
```

Build and run the application
=============================

We are provisioning a web server with support for web session sharing.

* Build application image: 
```
oc new-app wildfly-s2i-chained-build-template -p APPLICATION_NAME=web-clustering \
      -p GIT_REPO=https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i \
      -p GIT_CONTEXT_DIR=examples/web-clustering \
      -p GALLEON_PROVISION_LAYERS=web-server,web-clustering,observability \
      -p IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE=myproject
```

* Create application from application image: 
```
oc new-app myproject/web-clustering -e KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE=myproject -e JGROUPS_CLUSTER_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

NB: The KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE is required to see other pods in the project, otherwise the server attempts to retrieve pods from the 'default' namespace that is not the one our peoject is using.
JGROUPS_CLUSTER_PASSWORD is used to authenticate server in the cluster.

* Create a route:
```
oc expose svc/web-clustering
```

* Access the application route, note the user created time and session ID.

* Scale the application to 2 pods: 
```
oc scale --replicas=2 deployment web-clustering
```

* List pods: 
```
oc get pods
```

* Kill the oldest POD (that answered the first application request): 
```
oc delete pod web-clustering-1-r4cx8 -n myproject
```

* Access the application again, you will notice that the displayed values are the same, web session has been shared between the 2 pods.
